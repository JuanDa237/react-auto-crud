**Automatically generate production-ready CRUD tables and forms from Zod schemas.**

A powerful, type-safe React library that transforms Zod schemas into fully functional server-side CRUD interfaces with zero boilerplate. Built on top of industry-leading libraries: TanStack Query, TanStack Table, and shadcn/ui.

## Tailwind (required)

If your app uses Tailwind v4 (CSS-first), add this to your global CSS so responsive utilities like breakpoints are generated for this package:

```css
@source "../node_modules/react-auto-crud/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}";
```
